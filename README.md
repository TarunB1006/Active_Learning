**Active Transfer Learning README**

Welcome to the Active Transfer Learning repository! This repository contains a single Python script designed to perform uncertainty sampling and least confidence sampling while ensuring an equal number of samples are taken per label in the context of active transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet model. The script takes as input a dataset (`data`) and corresponding labels (`labels`), along with a pre-trained ResNet model (`model`). By specifying the number of samples to select per label, users can ensure balanced representation across different classes during the active learning process. This script offers a streamlined solution for implementing active learning strategies in the context of transfer learning, leveraging the power of pre-trained models for enhanced model performance. Currently Under Progress!! ðŸš€
